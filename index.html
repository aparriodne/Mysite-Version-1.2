    <p>I have always been in the trade world working with my primary focus on thing mechanical. Though that is my primary skill I have worked so many different positions and I have learned a very wide variety of skills. No matter the job though always the parts I enjoy the most is finding solutions to problems and having my creativity and logic tested.<br> My most frequented hobbies are instruments, cooking, drawing, and strategy games. But the number one thing I enjoy doing with my free time is learn a new skills. I would say my strongest outlet for creativity is writing, specifically poetry. </p> <br>
